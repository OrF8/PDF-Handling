# ðŸŽ“ PDF-Handling

This repository is a personal toolkit for generating and managing PDF course summaries for my university studies. \
It contains scripts and utilities that help automate the process of formatting, editing, and adding structure (e.g., bookmarks) to PDF documents.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to streamline my own academic workflow by:
- Creating structured and easily navigable course summaries.
- Organizing lecture notes and study materials into clean, well-formatted PDFs.
- Reducing repetitive manual work involved in handling educational PDFs.

## Usage

This repository is intended for **personal use only**. \
Scripts and utilities are written and adapted for my own file structures, course naming conventions, and formatting preferences. \
No general-purpose functionality or user support is provided.

## Credits

The course content used to generate the PDF summaries is Â© Or Forshmit and/or [Noam Kimhi](https://github.com/noam-kimhi) and/or HUJI staff. \
This repository only formats and structures those materials into organized PDF files for personal study purposes.
